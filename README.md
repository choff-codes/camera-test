# camera-test

Python program designed for an inhouse tool meant to measure the quality of their production camera lenses meant for medical equipment.

Uses opencv and numpy to take in images from the camera, detect irregularities, compare those against a threshold, and output a new image with a small red rectangle around each
irregularity on the initial image. 

Examples of input and output images can be found in '/output-photos'.
